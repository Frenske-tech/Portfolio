## 1. You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

For my individual project I chose to work with react and java spring boot, the main reason I chose to work with react in this project is because it has backing from facebook and a rather large community, I think it will be relevant longer then other frontend frameworks like vue. I chose to use java spring boot for my project because i'm already pretty familiar with c# having used it for a few semesters now, so i thought it would be a good idea to try something new something that most likely sooner or later i would've worked with eventually. Java is also a popular language and provides a clean and efficient oop based platform.

Looking back i really enjoyed working with java spring boot over something im more used to like c# mostly because i found it to be a good way of setting up projects. so i would most definitly use spring boot again in future semesters.

i used to use mysql locally to run the application, but this would to be hard to run with docker so i switched to a h2 database. in the full version of this application i wouldnt have used an in memory database i would have had to search for an alternative.

Looking back at the semester i would use react again, in the group project i worked with vue and i have to say my experiences with react have been more postive then the ones i have had with vue. The major problem i have with vue is probably because we used vue3 for our project where things like bootstrap for vue werent even available for vue3 so we had to resort to regular bootstrap.

Within my individual application i used material ui for textfields and the rating however i should've spent more time with the styling of the application in particular i think my application certaintly isn't a looker at the moment.

also a link to documentation file 

[Documentation](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/Portfolio/blob/main/IP/Documentation/Documentationdoc.md)

Adding a review and scoring it. looking back at the project i should've done more about the look of the websites and i think websockets could've been good for my project.

Gamename needs to be added by users themselves currently has no connection to a premade game I was planning on doing it but there were more urgent things I needed to do, looking back i should've done more especially the styling should've been done better and nicer. i did do some research about ux and a usability test for my group project which can be found [here](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/Portfolio/blob/main/GP/Documentation/Architectuurdocument.md) and [here](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/Portfolio/blob/main/GP/Learning%20outcomes/UsabilityTest.md) and the [frontend](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/sem3Frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/sem3Backend) repo's

In my app you can review games/ movies give them a star rating, some explanation for why and  the username gets passed so everyone can see who posted it.

You need to logged in in order to post a review

![Knipsel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/174431426-564f7cba-af4f-4e31-a4ef-8e2f9765545c.PNG)

A fairly straightforward list of the different reviews this could&#39;ve used more work and some user testing but I did both those things for the group project in de form of ux testing and a usability test. Which I will link to [here](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/Portfolio/blob/main/GP/Documentation/Architectuurdocument.md) and [here](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/Portfolio/blob/main/GP/Learning%20outcomes/UsabilityTest.md)

here is the controller which is being called

# Auth0

I used Auth0 in order to let the user login to the application without needing to register. i worked on this because it is very important for my application to use oauth is order to let the user post reviews.

![lo3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833204-89830252-50f8-4c8c-940c-35d32f7bd8f2.png)

![lo4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833203-25c1ccae-e5f3-4965-b3ad-7b6bf034b8c6.png)

The picture isn&#39;t showing but that is on my account, on another account is does work

There is also the option to log out.

To work with auth0 I used a tutorial [https://auth0.com/blog/spring-boot-authorization-tutorial-secure-an-api-java/](https://auth0.com/blog/spring-boot-authorization-tutorial-secure-an-api-java/), which already contained a frontend so I used that

![lo5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833200-be87b892-c8d7-4d45-a094-405b3aed770a.png)

When you&#39;re logged in with correct roles u can add edit and delete items.

![lo6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833199-6d3e8b3c-8f21-4ad4-bb60-4f9cf3b9269c.png)

![lo7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833191-88280588-2905-42a1-802e-f3db926a5125.png)

This checks whether the user actually has the authority in the frontend this is also filtered when you&#39;re not logged in or without the permission buttons wont show up


## 2. You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

A link to the files where the tests are located [here](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/sem3Backend/tree/main/review/src/test/java/com/example/review)

### Unit testing

I used unit tests to ensure all my methods work like i expect them to. and making changes the unit test that run when i push to main and run the cicd ensures the core functionlities always work.

![lo9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833257-6208d75e-33e4-43d6-8dba-fe968261374d.png)


### Integration testing

With integration tests the entire process is tested, i did this with mockmvc. mockmvc allows you to send a fake http request and see how the controller behaves. i used these to check how all the layers worked together and to see if the most important functions would work.

![lo10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833256-ce36c85a-0ef5-45b5-a331-1f907df605ac.png)

I&#39;ve got one  integration test checking the controller to retrieve all reviews. 
![lo11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833254-95f7d860-0655-47be-ae72-262cfca02fa0.png)

The integration test for creating the review i worked out later with help of a student.

![test2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/174022280-04f84d61-2b78-4146-b28a-55f23b86ac91.PNG)

I also added sonar cloud in order to check bugs and vulnerabilities within my code as you can see there is most Definitely still work to do

I did this very late in the project in the future i will be implementing this earlier to ensure there are as little bugs and problems as possible.

![lo13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833249-db3ff36a-1e4f-40b3-afca-6d02badd907a.png)

![sc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/174450489-07fc1c70-9e30-450c-98cf-86693ab66211.PNG)

You can also see the review the bugs and see why it is an issue although in my case its about the tests im running so it isn&#39;t high priority

### Database
i used h2 database to run the application and also for the testing, because its and in memory database, the database won't get filled with all of the test data i dont want any where near the application. also because the h2 database is always empty on startup the tests run faster.

# 4. You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

I implemented cicd withing my project to be able to push it to docker in order to more easily share the project and run test to check wether or not all the core functions still work, i will however in the future implement testing and the cicd earlier to ensure it will be used efficiently. i chose to push it to docker instead of deploying it to a website because of the time restraint i experienced towards the end of the semester.

With github actions before a push or pull request on master I will run tests and when the tests check out it will push an image to docker hub
this is my workflow for my [backend](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/sem3Backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven.yml) and [frontend](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/sem3Frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/react.yml)

![lo14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833246-6aa48763-1814-4440-b63d-de74213e0a9e.png)

![lo15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833242-6faafd89-357e-403c-8f01-b88445dd0dae.png)

![lo16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833239-15e78eb1-4d6c-49b2-a9f4-8a974c66f047.png)

This was the first version for the backend

And the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/sem3Backend/blob/main/review/Dockerfile) I used

![lo17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833236-0d582beb-9081-4fa9-888b-b7237aa42b5c.png)

Later I added in Sonarcloud as well to perform static code analysis and discover potential weak point in my code which I wrote about in the previous chapter

![lo19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833229-fe63c739-0019-4235-87d0-05b269540360.png)

All tasks completed and a new image was pushed to docker

I also did this for the frontend in order to be able to run it together this also pushes an image to another docker repository

![lo20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833227-9c580234-6e78-4bf9-99b5-5831c0777f05.png)

And the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/sem3Frontend/blob/main/sem3frontend/Dockerfile)

![lo21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833225-fa52691a-cbdf-437e-809b-0259ce64d75e.png)

All tasks completed and an image is pushed.

![lo23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833220-cca2bb51-a843-4336-bb57-5c8e2d12dc65.png)

the repos in dockerhub

![Knipsel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/174252242-970b113e-8353-41a7-9d16-7f45d035784d.PNG)

Both running on different ports I did have some issues getting them to run together but after I added the -p tag to the docker run command it worked and the frontend and backend communicated 

## 8. You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.

I uploaded every research I made unto github in the portfolio and in its own public repository so everyone can find and use it.

Project board here I have user stories im working on and under every user story there&#39;s different tasks I need to finish to split up the user story even more. I started the semester really not using my jira board but gradually towards the end of the year is started using it more and more helping me keep track of my progress and my todos

![lo24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173833217-e44085de-2819-45da-ab18-f60a9e6ef19b.png)

Some more user stories and tasks within them [here](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/Portfolio/blob/main/IP/Documentation/Documentationdoc.md)

I have a lot of problems keeping my concentration when I&#39;m working I was recommended a certain method by my teacher called pomodoro. Pomodoro breaks up your workday in 25 minutes of work and then a 5 minute break, this helped me keep my concentration and the 5 minute break helped me get a fresh look at things the website I used

# Research

I also wrote a few researches where I used the dot framework and apa style for references
The first about logging in with identity providers such as auth0. I made this because it was important for my application to be able to login.

[IdentityProvider](https://github.com/Frenske-tech/Portfolio/blob/main/IP/Research/ResearchReportLogin.md)

the second about User stories. I made this because at the beginning of the semester i had some trouble creating/writing relevant user stories valuable to the project.
