# User stories

Some of the user stories I worked on

![Userstory1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/171407957-d93be285-4932-4e43-9b78-5bff5a86e349.PNG)

These all have individual tasks where I connected hours in order to keep track of my progress.

![Userstory3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/171407954-0155442c-d0ca-44bb-ac8e-b3e4d70fc1d6.PNG)

# C-4 model

![c1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/171403809-56057589-6721-43ed-886a-c4577c47e284.PNG)

In this c4 you can see a reviewer/user needs to be logged in, in order to post a review reading posted reviews does not need the user to be logged in

Same as before a user needs to be logged in, in order to post a review, the review app communicates with the backend application which saves said review in a database

![DomainModel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71487939/173794743-88e5ea12-a883-4298-97aa-02398855d34e.PNG)

Here is a domain model describing what the application would have looked like, a user posts a review which contains a game and the game has a totalreviewscore which takes the average user score
