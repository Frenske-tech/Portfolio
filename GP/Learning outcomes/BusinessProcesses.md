## Introduction

In this document I will be describing several processes which would normally happen within a restaurant and then the effects our application will have on them and how it will be improved.

## Business processes

**Ordering a meal** :

1. wait for a waiter to show up with a menu or menu on table
2. wait for waiter to return to your table
3. give waiter your order
4. wait for waiter to return with your order
5. eat your meal

with our app:

1. wait for waiter to show up with the tablet
2. input your order on the tablet
3. the waiters will bring your meal and drinks
4. eat your meal

This encourages the user to take whatever time they need without worrying about when the waiter will return.

**Paying for the meal:**

1. finish eating your meal
2. wait for waiter to ask for cheque
3. wait for the cheque to arrive
4. pay for the meal

with our app:

1. finish eating your meal
2. see the cheque in the app
3. pay for your meal within the app

This enables the user to pay for the meal whenever they like which especially in crowded restaurants can save a lot of time.

It&#39;s much faster this way without having to wait for the waiter to show up.

Here you can see the middleman in the kitchen personnel is not needed anymore for this process.
