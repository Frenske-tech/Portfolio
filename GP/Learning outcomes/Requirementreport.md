## Introduction

In this document I will be showing a few requirements and estimates of how long it would take to make it.

## Requirements

All the requirements we initially setup

How it looks in the devops with estimated values but most of it went into the individual tasks

there are also some not user stories here which we could put hours into like portofolio, research and other things

## User stories

some of the user stories i worked on,

here for each user story we have acceptance criteria which is a requirement within the user story

this was mostly concerning the current order page kind of like a shopping cart page, within these user stories we made a lot of tasks and attached estimated hours and actual hours to it. In order to keep track of our progress.

this is an example of the added tasks behind the user stories obviously there&#39;s a lot of them
