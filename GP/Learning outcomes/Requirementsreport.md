How it looks in the devops with estimated values but most of it went into the individual tasks

there are also some not user stories here which we could put hours into like portofolio, research and other things

this was mostly concerning the current order page kind of like a shopping cart page, within these user stories we made a lot of tasks and attached estimated hours and actual hours to it. In order to keep track of our progress.

this is an example of the added tasks behind the user stories obviously there&#39;s a lot of them
